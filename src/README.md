- `start_date` is optional (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- If provided, `start_date` must be on or before `expiration_date`

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

Data is stored in MongoDB. The application seeds sample activities, teacher accounts,
and an example announcement when the database is empty.
